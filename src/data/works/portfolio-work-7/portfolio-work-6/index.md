description: "• Achieved an increase of 4.74 units for Rouge score and 3.60% for Accuracy@1 improvements for few‑shot learning in Flan‑T5 transformer, by expanding their capacity to be able to process more in‑context example within the same context window length through sub‑batching. </br>
• Inched closer to finetuning‑like performance through pure in‑context learning (ICL) by 2.16 units of Rouge score and 3% for Accuracy@1 through
mesa‑optimization where the transformer acts like an optimizer itself during inference. </br>
• Improved the cross‑domain transfer capabilities of a transformer (Flan‑T5) by 1.68 units for Rouge score and 1.3% for Accuracy@1 through
incorporating both cross‑ and within domain question‑answer samples within a limited context window length of 512 tokens. </br>
• Evaluated and verified the effectiveness of both sub‑batched ICL and mesa‑optimization during inference on both Adobe and public datasets."
