However, personalization has been only studied at a coarse granularity where all the input instances of a client (heterogeneous or otherwise) only use its individual local model, despite it being limited to only that client's data. Flow explores instance-level personalization through dynamically making routing decisions between the local and the global model, with the aim of achieving superior personalized performance for a given instance. Besides, as cross-device FL deals with millions of resource-constrained client devices, we push towards stateless personalization where a client doesn't need to carry its personalized state across FL rounds."}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/research-1/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"July 16, 2022","title":"Flash: Concept Drift Adaptation in Federated Learning","tags":["Federated Learning","Concept Drift","Drift Adaptation","Adaptive Optimization"],"authors":["Kunjal Panchal","Sunav Choudhary","Koyel Mukherjee","Subrata Mitra","Somdeb Sarkhel","Saayan Mitra","Hui Guan"],"venue":"Published @ ICML, 2023","period":"July 2023","url":"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/panchal23a/panchal23a.pdf","description":"In Federated Learning (FL), adaptive optimization is an effective approach to addressing the statistical heterogeneity issue but cannot adapt quickly to concept drifts. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive optimizer called Flash that simultaneously addresses both statistical heterogeneity and the concept drift issues.  The fundamental insight is that a concept drift can be detected based on the magnitude of parameter updates that are required to fit the global model to each participating client's local data distribution. Flash uses a two-pronged approach that synergizes client-side early-stopping  training to facilitate detection of concept drifts and the server-side drift-aware adaptive optimization to effectively adjust effective learning rate. We theoretically prove that Flash matches the convergence rate of state-of-the-art adaptive optimizers and further empirically evaluate the efficacy of Flash on a variety of FL benchmarks using different concept drift settings.

However, there is a gap in using single-agent chatbots to converse and gather multi-faceted information across a wide variety of topics. Prior works suggest that single-agent chatbots struggle to understand user intentions and interpret human language during a multi-faceted conversation. In this work, we investigated how multi-agent chatbot systems can be utilized to conduct a multi-faceted conversation across multiple domains. To that end, we conducted a Wizard of Oz study to investigate the design of a multi-agent chatbot for gathering public input across multiple high-level domains and their associated topics. Next, we designed, developed, and evaluated CommunityBots - a multi-agent chatbot platform where each chatbot handles a different domain individually. To manage conversation across multiple topics and chatbots, we proposed a novel Conversation and Topic Management (CTM) mechanism that handles topic-switching and chatbot-switching based on user responses and intentions. We conducted a between-subject study comparing CommunityBots to a single-agent chatbot baseline with 96 crowd workers. The results from our evaluation demonstrate that CommunityBots participants were significantly more engaged, provided higher quality responses, and experienced fewer conversation interruptions while conversing with multiple different chatbots in the same session. We also found that the visual cues integrated with the interface helped the participants better understand the functionalities of the CTM mechanism, which enabled them to perceive changes in textual conversation, leading to better user satisfaction. Based on the empirical insights from our study, we discuss future research avenues for multi-agent chatbot design and its application for rich information elicitation.
